## Notes & Limitations
3D sphere animation inside the Product section may be resource-intensive on low-end devices or older browsers.

The scroll spring effect is dependent on the browser rendering performance.

Some assets like images and 3D visuals are fetched from external sources; make sure you're connected to the internet.

The layout is mobile-friendly but further responsive tuning could be beneficial for smaller devices.
